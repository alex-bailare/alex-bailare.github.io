      <p>Hi, My name is Alex! I am a Software Engineer/Developer and Connoisseur. This means I can write hello world programms in various languages and enjoy food. I was born and live in the United States, but haven't really gone out of the country much. I feel like seeing more of the world &#x1F30E; one day so that I can eat different types of food.</p>
      <p>Since I mentioned food, I guess I should say that I like hamburgers &#x1F354;. Pizza still remains one of my favorite foods despite my decent interest in burgers. One of the main reasons I want to go around the world is food as I've previously mentioned, so maybe I should search for my favorite food too. Water is the best btw.</p>
      <p>I have also worked at Victoria's Secret &#x1F45A; so you can consider me a professional panty folder!</p>

          <p>This image may look familiar, and that is because it's the hero image to this page. This page is made using HTML5 and Sass. Sass really helps keep the styling organized so it's not too difficult to find things that I want to tweak. Since I'm not really using any frameworks it can be somewhat of a challenge to get everything to go where I want it. At least I'm learning!</p>

          <p>This is a wolf. I think they look pretty cool. I fancy myself as being a dog person but maybe I just need to hang out with more cats. I'll give them a chance even though a cat ate my parakeet once.</p>
